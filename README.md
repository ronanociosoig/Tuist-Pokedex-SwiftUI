# Pokedex SwiftUI

This project is based on work done in the [Tuist-Pokedex] (https://github.com/ronanociosoig-200/Tuist-Pokedex) repo except that it is implemented using SwiftUI and using [swiftui-navigation](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swiftui-navigation) and [swift-dependencies](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies) from [PointFree](https://www.pointfree.co/). 

It is only a proof of concept to play around with those libraries, and does not have test coverage, or makes any efforts in modularisation.
